Express Validators (https://express-validator.github.io/docs/guides/getting-started)
==================
-An express.js middleware for validator.
-can validate and sanitize express requests.
-Validation chains are created by functions such as body(), param(), query(), and so on.
-Validators determine if the value of a request field is valid.
-Sanitizers transform the field value.
-Modifiers define how validation chains behave when they are run.
 This might include adding conditions on when they should run

ex:
const createEmailChain = () => body('email').isEmail();
app.post('/login', createEmailChain(), handleLoginRoute);
app.post('/signup', createEmailChain().custom(checkEmailNotInUse), handleSignupRoute);
