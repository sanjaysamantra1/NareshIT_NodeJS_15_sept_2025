PUT vs POST
-----------
-PUT for UPDATE operations, POST for CREATE operations.
-PUT is idempotent, where POST is non-idempotent.
-Idempotence(producing the same result even if the same request is made multiple times)
-(PUT)if you retry a request N times, that should be equivalent to single request modification.
-(POST)if you retry the request N times, you will end up having N resources with N different URIs created on server.
-Use PUT when you want to modify a singular resource which is already a part of resources collection.
-Use POST when you want to add a child resource under resources collection.


PUT vs PATCH
------------
-PUT is used to replace a complete resource.
-PATCH is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
