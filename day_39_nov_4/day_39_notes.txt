GraphQL
=======
-GraphQL is a query language for APIs.
-Alternative to REST, providing more flexibility by allowing clients to request only the data they need.
-Uses a single endpoint for all requests.


Advantages of GraphQL
---------------------
Single Endpoint: Uses a single /graphql endpoint for all requests.
Flexible Queries: Clients can specify exactly what data they want.
Strongly Typed Schema: APIs are defined using a schema with types.
Real-time Updates: Supports subscriptions for real-time data updates.
Efficient Data Fetching: Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data.


		REST          		 	GraphQL
============================================
1. Server Driven            	1. Client Driven
2. Multiple endpoints			2. Single endpoint for all requests
3. Over-fetching data			3. Client requests exactly what is needed
4. No strict schema				4. Strongly typed schema
5. Requires WebSockets 			5. Built-in subscriptions for real-time updates
   or polling separately


Concept			Description
===============================
Query			Fetch data (read-only)
Mutation		Modify data
Schema			Defines data types & relationships
Resolver		Function that resolves a query or mutation



Graphql and graphql-http
-------------------------
1. create a project 
   npm init -y
2. install required packages
   npm install graphql graphql-http ruru
3. Create a GraphQL schema
   const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
    query: new GraphQLObjectType({
        name: 'Query',
        fields: {
            hello: {
                type: GraphQLString,
                resolve: () => 'Hello World !!',
            },
        },
    }),
 });
4. Define a route and call createHandler(Schema)
  app.all('/graphql', createHandler({ schema }));

5. serve RURU UI
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.end(ruruHTML({ endPoint: '/graphql' }))
   })

-Apollo Server is an open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server 
-Apollo Server is compatible with any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client. 
-To build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source.
-It has its own UI (doesn't use RURU)
