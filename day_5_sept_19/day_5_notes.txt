Function
========
-Block of code which performs a specific task.

1. Pre-Defined : console.log(),Math.max(), Math.min()
2. User-Defined : we have to write function logic & invoke them
    a. Function Declaration
    b. Function Expression
    c. Arrow Function (ES_6) 2015

Function Declaration vs Function Expression
============================================
1. Function declarations are named , function expressions are anonymous
2. Function declarations are hoisted , function expressions are not hoisted


Arrow Function (ES_6) 2015
==============
-Shorter in syntax
-implicit return
-good to be used as callbacks
-doesnt have its own 'this' value , Lexical 'this'
-'this' value is static


Arrow function Limitations
===========================
-cannot be used as constructor
-Shouldn't be used as object methods
-Shouldn't be used when 'this' should be dynamic


how 'this' works in a regular function & arrow function
=========================================================
-Regular Function : this - how/where the function is called
-Arrow Function : this - where the function is written (outer scope / lexical scope)
